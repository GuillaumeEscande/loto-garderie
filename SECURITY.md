## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

If you believe you have found a security issue in this project, please report it in one of the following ways:

1. **Preferred:** Use [GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for this repository (if enabled), or open a **draft security advisory** via the repository’s **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**.

2. If you need to contact the maintainers privately by email, check the repository description or maintainer profile for a contact address and mention “Garderie security” in the subject.

When reporting, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and how to reproduce it.
- The affected version or commit (if known).
- The impact you think it could have (e.g. data exposure, authentication bypass).
- Any suggested fix or mitigation, if you have one (optional).

### What You Can Expect

- We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible.
- We will work with you to understand and address the issue.
- We will keep you informed about the progress and any fix or advisory.
- We may credit you in the advisory or release notes if you wish (please say so in your report).

### Disclosure

We follow coordinated disclosure: we ask that you do not make the vulnerability public until a fix or advisory has been published (or we have agreed on a disclosure timeline). Exceptions (e.g. for already public or actively exploited issues) can be discussed.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe.
